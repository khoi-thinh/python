# Who is millinaire!!!
I'm learning python from the scratch and want to write something, so that's where this little game comes in

1. Install python 
Centos 6: - rpm -ivh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
          - yum -y install python-pip
Centos 7: - rpm -iUvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
          - yum -y install python-pip
2. chmod +x who-is-millionaire.py 
3. Run with this command: python who-is-millionaire.py
Have fun!
